        <p>Computer software, also called software, 
        is a set of instructions and documentation that tells a computer what to do or how to perform a task. Software includes all different programs on a computer, 
        such as applications and the operating system. Applications
        are programs that are designed to perform a specific operation, such as a game or a word processor. The operating system (e.g. Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, Android and various Linux distributions) is a type of software that is used as a platform for running the applications, and controls 
        all user interface tools including display and the keyboard.

        <h2>Software - History</h2>
        The first use of the word software is credited to
        mathematician John Wilder Tukey in 1958. 
        The first programmable computers, which appeared at 
        the end of the 1940s, were programmed in machine 
        language. Machine language is difficult to debug 
        and not portable across different computers.

        <h2>Types of Software</h2>
        <p>Operating systems are "the layer of software that manages a computer's resources for its users and their applications". There are three main purposes that an operating system fulfills. Application software runs on top of the operating system and uses the computer's resources to perform a task.There are many different types of application software because the range of tasks that can be performed with modern computers is so large. Applications account for most software  and require the environment provided by an operating system, and often other applications, in order to function. <br />
